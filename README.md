# BrailleZephyr

## Important Notice

BrailleZephyr is now replaced by [BrailleZ](https://github.com/mwhapples/BrailleZ). It appears that working with upstream will not be possible and so a rebrand has been done to make this a distinct product separate from that of BrailleZephyr from American Printing House for the Blind. To continue getting updates, please install [BrailleZ](https://mwhapples.github.io/BrailleZ/download.html). Sorry for the inconvenience caused by this change but it was necessary.

## Description

* Runs on Windows, Mac or Linux.

* Ability to set page width (cells across) and depth (lines down).
* Bell for margin warning, user settable.
